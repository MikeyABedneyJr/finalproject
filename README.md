This is my Codefellows final project.
The purpose is to make a visual demonstration on one (of the many) ways to sort the data from an array.
This has gotten me familiar with GitHub (and gits in general).

Not wanting to continuously update the readme, I will put it as this:
The project has been incredibly challenging despite what we have covered in this month-long course. I suspect that those who came with a more solid understanding may have been successful. At this time, I suspect that this will be unfinished before the deadline.  I may return to this in the future.
