This is my Codefellows final project.
The purpose is to make a visual demonstration on one (of the many) ways to sort the data from an array.
This has gotten me familiar with GitHub (and gits in general).

I will summarize the project this way:
The project has been incredibly challenging despite what we have covered in this month-long course. I suspect that those who came with a more solid understanding may have been successful. 
I will not be able to finish this assignment before the deadline.

Current functionality:
The "recess" button correctly randomizes the order of the students.
The "Whistle" button correctly sorts them into alphabetical order.

Future upgrades:
*Slowly sort the students rather than all at once, in an instant (setTimeout was not workin no matter where I put it)
*Instead of alphabetical order, randomize the image heights and have it sort from biggest height to smallest (might be a major task)
*Add noise when whistle and recess buttons are pushed.
